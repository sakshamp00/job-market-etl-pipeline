# Job Market ETL Pipeline

An end-to-end Python ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that collects job market data from a public API, cleans and deduplicates the data, and loads it into a local SQLite database for analysis.

It includes:
- Extraction of job listings from an external API (RapidAPI)
- Data cleaning, deduplication, and timestamping using Pandas
- Loading into a relational SQLite database with primary key constraints
- Modular pipeline orchestration for easy re-runs and updates

This project demonstrates core data engineering concepts such as API ingestion, data transformation with Pandas, idempotent database loading, and pipeline orchestration.

# 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sakshamp00/job-market-etl-pipeline.git
   cd etl-pipeline
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a ```.env``` file with your API key:

    ```bash
    API_KEY=your_rapidpaikey_here
    ```

# 🛠️ Usage

Run the main ETL pipeline from the project root:

    python -m job_market_etl_pipeline.main

You’ll see the console output at each stage of the ETL process:
- Extraction of the raw job data via the API key
- Transformation and cleaning of the data
- Loading the clean data into the SQLite database

# 📊 Example Output

After running the pipeline:
```
Starting ETL pipeline...
Extracting job data...
Saved raw data → rawData/jobs_raw_20260130_121508.json
Transforming job data...
Saved clean data → cleanData/jobs_clean_20260130_121508.csv
Loaded data from cleanData/jobs_clean_20260130_121508.csv into the database.
Rows in DB: 19
ETL pipeline finished successfully!
```

Database verification with SQLite:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM jobs;
SELECT job_title, employer_name FROM jobs LIMIT 5;
```
